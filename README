This project gathers "magical" feathers that give Dumbo the confidence he needs 
to be able to fly. More precisely, it consists of Java classes that can be very 
useful for Dumbo (http://last.fm/dumbo) programs that run on Hadoop Streaming.


BUILDING FEATHERS

Run "sh build.sh".


USING FEATHERS

Add the option "-libjar feathers.jar" to your dumbo command.
